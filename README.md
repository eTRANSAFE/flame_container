# Flame web service (UPF prototype)

In this repository you will find:

+ A Dockerfile to build a Flame (modellin framework) container image
+ `docker-compose.yml` with the configuration to build and serve a web service with two containers: Flame and Padel.

Only the flame container has a build command since it is under active development. 

The images are pulled from the eTransafe docker registry hosted at DTU
